# Detection_of_Botnet_In_IOT_devices_using_ML
## Introduction:
With the rapid boom and popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, a rising number of cyber-attacks are being launched in opposition to them. Malicious third parties have threatened IoT structures and resulted in wide usage. Realistic security and investigation countermeasures, such as community intrusion detection and network forensic systems, ought to be built to meet this challenge. A well-structured and consultant dataset is essential for coaching and validating the systems' credibility in this regard. Despite the fact that many network datasets exist, most of them have little important points about the Botnet eventualities that have been used.
Botnets have the following important ambitions, sending spam, launching a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, and disseminating false facts from illegal sources are all examples of data dissemination. Information harvesting entails amassing a person's name, password, and economic information. Information processing entails analyzing statistics in order to smash a password that will provide get entry to extra hosts. BASHLILE and Mirai, for example, are two famous IoT malware traces that have contaminated a large range of IoT devices, exposing them to flaws and acknowledged authentication credentials.

## Dataset:
Download the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT that includes both actual and simulated IoT network traffic, as properly as various sorts of attacks. With the assist of this dataset, we experimented a method to become aware of the botnets in IoT devices. There is both benign and malicious traffic in the data. The dataset is divided into files for each device, with each file including a different type of traffic, such as normal traffic or attacks. Using two families of botnet attack programs from github, ten different types of attacks were created (Mirai, Gafgyt). This dataset contains 115 features that were retrieved from packet traffic over time. 

The dataset contains the following devices normal & attack traffic.

Danmini - Doorbell

Ecobee - Thermostat

Philips - Baby Monitor

Ennio - Doorbell

Provision - Security Camera

Samsung SNH 1011 N - Webcam
